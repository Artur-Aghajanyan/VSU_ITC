    <h2>Greek mythology, body of stories concerning the gods, heroes, and rituals of the ancient Greeks. That the myths contained a considerable
 element of fiction was recognized by the more critical Greeks, such as the philosopher Plato in the 5th4th century BCE. In general, however, 
in the popular piety of the Greeks, the myths were viewed as true accounts. Greek mythology has subsequently had extensive influence on the arts
 and literature of Western civilization, which fell heir to much of Greek culture. Although people of all countries, eras, and stages of 
civilization have developed myths that explain the existence and workings of natural phenomena, recount the deeds of gods or heroes, or seek to 
justify social or political institutions, the myths of the Greeks have remained unrivaled in the Western world as sources of imaginative and 
appealing ideas. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have discovered 
contemporary significance and relevance in Classical mythological themes.

		<h3>God of the Sky</h3>
		<p>
		   Zeus was the king of the Olympian gods and the supreme deity in Greek religion. Often referred to as the Father, as the god of
 thunder and the 'cloud-gatherer', he controlled the weather, offered signs and omens and generally dispensed justice, guaranteeing order amongst
 both the gods and humanity from his seat high on Mt. Olympus.

		<h3>Goddess of Marriage, Mothers and Families</h3>
		<p>
		    Hera (Roman name: Juno) is the wife of Zeus and queen of the ancient Greek gods. She represented the ideal woman and was the
 goddess of marriage and the family. Although always faithful herself, Hera was most famous for her jealous and vengeful nature, principally 
aimed against the lovers of her husband and their illegitimate offspring.

		<h3>God of the Sea</h3>
		<p>
		    Poseidon was the Greek god of the sea and rivers, creator of storms and floods, and the bringer of earthquakes and 
destruction. He was perhaps the most disruptive of all the ancient gods but he was not always a negative force. He was a protector to mariners 
and, as a tamer of horses, the patron of that animal and horse breeding. To the Romans, he was known as Neptune.

		<h3>God of the Underworld</h3>
		<p>
		    Hades was both the name of the ancient Greek god of the underworld (Roman name: Pluto) and the name of the shadowy place 
below the earth which was considered the final destination for the souls of the dead. Perhaps the most feared of the gods, he is described by 
both Homer and Hesiod as 'pitiless', 'loathsome', and 'monstrous' Hades. The god's wife was Persephone whom he abducted to join him in the 
underworld, and his symbol is a sceptre or cornucopia.

		<h3>Goddess of Agriculture</h3>
		<p>
		    Demeter was one of the oldest gods in the ancient Greek pantheon. As a goddess of agriculture, she guaranteed the fertility 
of the earth and protected both farming and vegetation. This close connection with the earth was inherited from her mother Rhea. Demeter was 
probably a reincarnation of local mother Earth goddesses, commonly worshipped in rural communities in Bronze Age Greece.

The sanctuary at Eleusis is dedicated to both the goddess and her daughter Persephone. This was the location of the famous Eleusinian Mysteries.
 From Eleusis, the idea spread across the Archaic and Classical Greek worlds that Demeter would protect her worshippers in the afterlife. 
To the Romans, the goddess remained popular and was known as Ceres.

		<h3>God of War</h3>
		<p>
		    Ares was the Greek god of war and perhaps the most unpopular of all the Olympian gods because of his quick temper, 
aggressiveness, and unquenchable thirst for conflict. He famously seduced Aphrodite, unsuccessfully fought with Hercules, and enraged Poseidon 
by killing his son Halirrhothios. One of the more human Olympian gods, he was a popular subject in Greek art and even more so in Roman times 
when he took on a much more serious aspect as Mars, the Roman god of war.

and certainly the most resourceful of the Olympian gods.

		<h3>God of archery, music, poetry, prophecy, medicine, and later on the god of the sun.</h3>
		<p>
		    Apollo was a major Greek god associated with the bow, music, and divination. The epitome of youth and beauty, source of life
 and healing, patron of the arts, and as bright and powerful as the sun itself, Apollo was, arguably, the most loved of all the gods. He was 
worshipped at Delphi and Delos, amongst the most famous of all Greek religious sanctuaries.

Son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, Apollo was born on the island of Delos (in Hesiod's Theogony he is clutching a golden 
sword). His mother, fearful of revenge from Zeus' wife Hera, had chosen barren Delos as the safest retreat she could find. At his first taste of
 ambrosia, he was said to have immediately transformed from babe to man. Apollo was then given his bow, made by the master craftsman of Mount 
Olympus, Hephaestus.

		    Artemis was the Greek goddess of hunting, wild nature, and chastity. Daughter of Zeus and sister of Apollo, Artemis was a 
patron of girls and young women and a protectress during childbirth. She was widely worshipped but her most famous cult site was the Temple of 
Artemis at Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

		    Ancient Greek god of fire, metallurgy, and crafts, Hephaistos (Hephaestus) was the brilliant blacksmith of the Olympian gods,
 for whom he fashioned magnificent houses, armour, and ingenious devices. Hephaistos had his workshop beneath volcanos - Mount Etna on Sicily 
being a favourite haunt - and was, with his lame foot, unique as the only less-than-perfect god. To the Romans, he was known as Vulcan or 
Volcanus.

		<h3>Goddess of Love and Beauty</h3>
		<p>
		    Aphrodite was the ancient Greek goddess of love, beauty, desire, and all aspects of sexuality. She could entice both gods 
and men into illicit affairs with her beauty and whispered sweet nothings. Born near Cyprus from the severed genitalia of the sky god Uranus, 
Aphrodite had a wider significance than the traditional view as a mere goddess of love.

Worshipped by men, women, and city-state officials, Aphrodite also played a role in the commerce, warfare, and politics of ancient Greek cities.
 In addition, Aphrodite was honoured as a protector of those who travelled by sea and, less surprisingly, courtesans and prostitutes. The 
goddess' Roman equivalent was Venus.

		    Hermes was the ancient Greek god of trade, wealth, luck, fertility, animal husbandry, sleep, language, thieves, and travel. 
One of the cleverest and most mischievous of the Olympian gods, he was the patron of shepherds, invented the lyre, and was, above all, the 
herald and messenger of Mt. Olympus so that he came to symbolise the crossing of boundaries in his role as a guide between the two realms of 
gods and humanity. To the Romans, the god was known as Mercury.

Cronus and Rhea. In her role as a protector of the family and political community, sacrifices and offerings were regularly made to Hestia at the
 hearth within each private home and at the town or city's public hearth. To the Romans, the goddess was known as Vesta.

    <h3> <a name="myth1">Prometheus and the Theft of Fire</a></h3>
    <p>
        One day, Zeus distributed gifts to all the gods, but he didn't care much for humans. The Titan Prometheus, however, because he loved and
 felt sorry for humans, climbed up on Olympus and stole the fire from Hephaestus' workshop, put it in a hollow reed and gifted it to the humans. 
This way, humans could create fire, warm up and make tools. Zeus became very angry when he heard about this. He took Prometheus to a high 
mountain, the Caucasus, and chained him on a rock with thick chains made by the smith god, Hephaestus. And every day, Zeus would send an eagle 
that ate Prometheus liver. For thirty years Prometheus remained bound in the Caucasus, until the great hero Hercules, Zeus demigod son, 
released him finally from his torment.
    </p>
    <h3> <a name="myth2">Daedalus and Icarus</a></h3>
    <p>
        The labyrinth in King Minos palace was designed by a famous inventor and engineer, Daedalus. It is said that Athena herself taught 
Daedalus. King Minos commissioned to Daedalus and his son Icarus the construction of the labyrinth that would held the monster Minotaur. After 
finishing their work, King Minos imprisoned father and son inside the labyrinth, in an effort to prevent knowledge of his labyrinth from 
spreading to the public. Father and son were thinking hard on how to escape until Daedalus came up with an idea. They gathered a lot of feathers 
from birds and glued them together with wax thus, making four large wings. They tied the wings to each shoulder and fled from the island of 
Crete. Daedalus had warned Icarus not to fly close to the sun because the wax would melt. After passing the island of Delos, the boy, forgetting 
himself, flew high towards the sun. The hot sun softened the wax that held the feathers together and Icarus fell in the sea and drowned. Daedalus 
named the place where his son fell Icaria, in his memory.
    </p>
    <h3> <a name="myth3">Goddess Athena and Arachne</a></h3>
    <p>
        In Greek Mythology Gods were powerful and humans should be obedient. But was that always the case? In ancient times there was a beautiful 
lady called Arachne (meaning spider in Greek). She knew the art of loom very well and she weaved beautifully. She boasted that she could weave 
better than Athena, who was the patroness of the weaving art. She even dared to ask the goddess to a contest. Athena accepted and they began to 
weave. Athena weaved a representation of her fight with Poseidon over the naming of Athena. Arachne, on the other hand, weaved the naughty 
adventures of Zeus and the other gods of Olympus. Athena, angered by the hubris Arachne dared to show, transformed her into a spider and cursed 
her to be hanging from her web for the remainder of her life.
    </p>
    <h3> <a name="myth4">King Midas and his Golden Touch</a></h3>
    <p>
        In Greek Mythology, Midas was the king of Phrygia and ruled from his castle and its beautiful garden in which roses grow of themselves,
 each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance, according to Herodotus. One day, some of Midas people found a drunken old man near 
the garden and brought him before the king. Midas recognized the old man, who was god Dionysus closest reveler, the satyr Silenus. Instead of 
punishing him, Midas hosted the satyr for ten days, offering him food, drinks and entertaining him. When he returned him safely to Dionysus, the 
god felt gratitude and offered Midas to grant him any wish he had. Midas, motivated by his greed, asked that he should be able to turn into gold 
everything he touched. At first, Midas gained great wealth and power from his unique ability. But he later realized that it was more of a curse 
than a gift. Even the water and the food that he touched was turning into gold. He could not enjoy even the simplest joys in life anymore. Midas 
went back to Dionysus and begged him to take back his power.
