    <h1>ATP Rankings</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>&emsp;The <b>ATP Rankings</b> are the merit-based method used by the <abbr
            title="Association of Tennis Professionals"><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals">ATP</a></abbr> for determining
        the qualification for entry as well as the seeding of players in all singles and doubles tournaments.
        The first rankings for singles were published on 23 August 1973 while the doubles players were ranked for the
        first time on 1 March 1976.
        Ranking points are awarded according to the stage of tournament reached, and the prestige of the tournament,
        with the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)">Grand Slam</a> tournaments awarding
        the most points.
        The rankings are updated every Monday, and points are dropped 52 weeks after being awarded (with the exception
        of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals">ATP Finals</a>, from which points are dropped on the
        Monday following the last ATP Tour event of the following year).
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic">Novak Djokovic </a>is the current world No.1.

    <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            &emsp;The ATP began as the man's trade union in 1972, through the combined efforts of Jack Kramer, 
            Cliff Drysdale, and Donald Dell, and rose to prominence when 81 of its members boycotted the 1973 Wimbledon Championships.
            Just two months later, in August, the ATP introduced its ranking system intended to objectify tournament entry criteria, 
            which up to that point was controlled by national federations and tournament directors.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;The ATP's new ranking system was quickly adopted by men's tennis.
             While virtually all ATP members were in favor of objectifying event participation, 
             the system's first No. 1, Ilie Năstase, lamented that "everyone had a number hanging over them," 
            fostering a more competitive and less collegial atmosphere among the players.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp;The original ATP ranking criteria, which was then regularly published weekly only from mid-1979 and persisted through the 1980s, 
            was based on averaging each player's results, though the details were revised a number of times.
            Starting in 1990, in conjunction with the expansion of ATP purview as the new men's tour operator, 
            the ranking criteria was replaced with a 'best of' system modeled after competitive downhill skiing.
             This 'best of' system originally used 14 events but expanded to 18 in 2000.
