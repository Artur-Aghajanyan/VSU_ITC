ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

    FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 

BERNARDO

    Who's there?

FRANCISCO

    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO

    Long live the king!

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo?

BERNARDO

    He.

FRANCISCO

    You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO

    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO

    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO

    Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO

    Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO

    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO

HORATIO

    Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo has my place.
    Give you good night.

BERNARDO

HORATIO

    A piece of him.

BERNARDO

    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO

    I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS

    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    That if again this apparition come,
